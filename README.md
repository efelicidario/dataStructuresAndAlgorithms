# Data Structures and Algorithms
CS 311 is the first upper-division course of our Computer Science major. It covers a number of basic data structures, including linked list, stack, queue, tree, graph, and hash tables, and the related sorting/searching algorithms. The primary goal of this course is to improve the studentsâ€™ programming skills in understanding, designing, and implementing data structures.  

- Master the implementation and utilization of commonly used data structures and algorithms.
- Know how to analyze time and space complexity of algorithms
- Know how to select or design efficient data structures and algorithms for a variety of problems.
- Develop skills for practicing modularity, information hiding, and efficiency in program design.
- Prepare you for the 400 level classes and job interviews!
